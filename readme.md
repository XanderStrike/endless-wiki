# endless wiki

_A vibe coded experiment in hallucination._

Endless wiki is an encyclopedia where everything can be an article, and every article is generated on the spot. 

These articles are invariably full of hallucinations and other nonsense outside of very fundamental topics. The fewer parameters the more hallucination, but any content in this app should be considered for entertainmnt purposes only.
