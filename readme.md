# endless wiki

_A vibe coded experiment in hallucination._

Endless wiki is an encyclopedia where everything can be an article, and every article is generated on the spot. 

These articles are invariably full of hallucinations and other nonsense outside of very fundamental topics. The fewer parameters the more hallucination, but any content in this app should be considered for entertainmnt purposes only.

If you _actually_ want to poke around on a local encyclopedia full of true information, consider my other project [wikiseek](https://github.com/XanderStrike/wikiseek)

## usage

The docker-compose.yml is everything you need including an ollama instance. Adjust the OLLAMA_MODEL to your preference or stick with the recommendation.

## demo

  <summary>gemma3:1b - pure delightful nonsense</summary>

Obviously higher parameter models provide more realistic articles at the cost of longer generation times.

  <summary>gemma3:12b - some accurate info</summary>

Since the article content is random every time, if you don't like the facts you've been stuck with you can always refresh to get new ones.
